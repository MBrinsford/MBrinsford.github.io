Hi everyone,

I will be using this page to host my blog on my progress changing career into CyberSecurity. 
I am currently training with TCM Security in penetration testing and have so far hacked two basic machines.
I am using a virtual Kali Linux machine set up with VMWare. All of the machines I have hacked have also been set up with VMWare.
